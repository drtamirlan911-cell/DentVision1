# DentVision — Release Blockers & Deferred Work Register

> Canonical working register for issues discovered during autonomous audit/release work. Items remain open until verified by tests/evidence.

## Open

### RB-001 — Medical/Dental Laboratory 403 Forbidden
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Diagnostics / Laboratory / RBAC
- **Observed:** medical-lab and dental-lab roles produce HTTP 403 on diagnostics-related requests in E2E.
- **Required:** trace exact method/URL, role, organization/laboratory context, authorization middleware, scope resolver and DB membership/tenant scope.
- **Finding (2026-09-21):** unified auth stores `organizationId` as the `Organization.id`, while laboratory/diagnostic scope checks and memberships require the underlying `Laboratory.id` (`Organization.originalId`). The authenticated context did not preserve that original entity ID, causing partner-lab scope checks to compare different identifiers and return 403.
- **Fix applied:** auth now carries `organizationOriginalId`; diagnostics, dental-lab platform, and medical-lab scope resolution use the original entity ID when resolving laboratory access.
- **Remaining:** CI verification is required; the same run also showed 500 responses for medical-lab roles, so those must be traced separately if they persist.
- **Verification:** positive/negative tests for medical-lab owner/technician and dental-lab owner/technician plus cross-lab isolation and CI evidence.

### RB-002 — Visual release gate: unnamed interactive controls
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Accessibility / Visual Release Gate
- **Observed:** prior E2E runs reported unnamed interactive controls, including diagnostics/lab roles.
- **Verification:** rerun after fixes; inspect DOM + screenshot + computed state; check hidden/mobile controls.

### RB-003 — Visual release gate: undersized touch targets
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Responsive / Accessibility
- **Observed:** Patient Portal / Shop and consent-related controls were below the required touch target.
- **Verification:** all critical mobile/tablet widths and interactive states.

### RB-004 — Full visual/design release evidence
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Release Gate
- **Required evidence:** screenshots, DOM/accessibility, computed styles, console/network, trace/video, real interactions across critical routes, roles, states and viewports.
- **Rule:** screenshots alone do not close this blocker.

### RB-005 — Browser/role/context regression after current fixes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** E2E / RBAC / UX
- **Required:** complete CI rerun after each root-cause fix; verify neighboring scenarios and negative authorization paths.

### RB-006 — Vercel build rate limit
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P1
- **Area:** Production deployment
- **Observed:** GitHub commit status reports Vercel failure with target reason `build-rate-limit` on current commits.
- **Required:** restore/verify successful production deployment status; do not treat a green GitHub test suite as a production release until deployment is independently confirmed.

### RB-007 — Mobile laboratory drawer visual regression
- **Status:** FIXED — pending CI visual recheck
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Responsive navigation / Mobile UX
- **Evidence:** failure artifact contained 24 screenshots across laboratory owner/technician variants. On 390px screenshots the open drawer shared the bottom-navigation z-layer, leaving bottom navigation visible above/through the drawer; the drawer width also left a large uncovered content area; the header rendered duplicate DentVision wordmark text.
- **Fix:** mobile drawer now uses a wider bounded width, z-layer above bottom navigation/backdrop, modal interaction semantics, Escape close and body scroll lock; duplicate header wordmark text removed.
- **Verification:** inspect all 390/412px lab-role screenshots after CI and exercise open/close/Escape/outside-click/touch behavior.

## Closed
_None yet._

## Operating rule
When a new blocker is discovered:
1. Add it here with a stable ID.
2. Keep it open until the root cause is fixed.
3. Record verification scenario/evidence.
4. Move it to Closed only with the fixing commit/run.

This file is the source of truth for deferred release blockers; they must not exist only in chat notes.
