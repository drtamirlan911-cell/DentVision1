# DentVision — Release Blockers & Deferred Work Register

> Canonical working register for issues discovered during autonomous audit/release work. Items remain open until verified by tests/evidence.

## Open

### RB-001 — Medical/Dental Laboratory 403 Forbidden
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Diagnostics / Laboratory / RBAC
- **Observed:** medical-lab and dental-lab roles produce HTTP 403 on diagnostics-related requests in E2E.
- **Required:** trace exact method/URL, role, organization/laboratory context, authorization middleware, scope resolver and DB membership/tenant scope.
- **Fix:** architectural authorization/scope fix; no frontend bypass.
- **Verification:** positive/negative tests for medical-lab owner/technician and dental-lab owner/technician plus cross-lab isolation and CI evidence.

### RB-002 — Visual release gate: unnamed interactive controls
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Accessibility / Visual Release Gate
- **Observed:** prior E2E runs reported unnamed interactive controls, including diagnostics/lab roles.
- **Verification:** rerun after fixes; inspect DOM + screenshot + computed state; check hidden/mobile controls.

### RB-003 — Visual release gate: undersized touch targets
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Responsive / Accessibility
- **Observed:** Patient Portal / Shop and consent-related controls were below the required touch target.
- **Verification:** all critical mobile/tablet widths and interactive states.

### RB-004 — Full visual/design release evidence
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** Release Gate
- **Required evidence:** screenshots, DOM/accessibility, computed styles, console/network, trace/video, real interactions across critical routes, roles, states and viewports.
- **Rule:** screenshots alone do not close this blocker.

### RB-005 — Browser/role/context regression after current fixes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Priority:** P0
- **Area:** E2E / RBAC / UX
- **Required:** complete CI rerun after each root-cause fix; verify neighboring scenarios and negative authorization paths.

## Closed
_None yet._

## Operating rule
When a new blocker is discovered:
1. Add it here with a stable ID.
2. Keep it open until the root cause is fixed.
3. Record verification scenario/evidence.
4. Move it to Closed only with the fixing commit/run.

This file is the source of truth for deferred release blockers; they must not exist only in chat notes.
